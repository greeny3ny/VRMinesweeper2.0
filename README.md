# VRMinesweeper2.0
New and improved minesweeper!

- Code overhaul, everything is so clean and can actually be read!
- Made a swap from THREE.js object to A-Frame objects , allowing for less object loaded and less lag
- Reveal tiles algorithm is still horrible... working to make that more efficient!
- A syncing system will hopefully be implemented too!


## To Do:
 ### - Sync system
 ### - High score board (either most solves, or fastest time)
 ### - System to change size of board and mines 
        (size change might require alot of variables changed... I may have used the wrong variable in places)
 ### - Make reveal tiles algorithm more efficient
 ### - Fireworks when win!
 ### - Explosions and death when lose!
