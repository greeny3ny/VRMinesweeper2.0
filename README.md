# VRMinesweeper2.0
New and improved minesweeper!

- Code overhaul, everything is so clean and can actually be read!
- Made a swap from THREE.js object to A-Frame objects , allowing for less object loaded and less lag
- Reveal tiles algorithm is still horrible... working to make that more efficient!
- A syncing system will hopefully be implemented too!
